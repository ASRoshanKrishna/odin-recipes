    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A fish fry is a fried fish meal that is battered or breaded. French fries, coleslaw, hushpuppies, lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar, and dessert are usually included. Some Native American recipes call for coating the fish with semolina and egg yolk.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In many Indian kitchens, a tava or tawa is a common frying pan. The pan, also known as a tawah, thawah, or thavah, is round and ranges in diameter from 8 to 12 inches. In some professional kitchens, it can be up to a meter wide. Tawa Fish Fry is a delicious, flavoured shallow fried seafood meal made with a few basic spices and herbs and cooked on a flat pan.</p>
