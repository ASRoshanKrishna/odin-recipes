        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It's time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.</li>
            <li>To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).</li>
            <li>Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons (or 3 to 4 tablespoons for a richer version) butter in a pan. Either salted or unsalted butter can be used.</li>
            <li>Keep the the heat to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds, or until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready-made ginger-garlic paste.</li>
            <li>Sauté until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears, about 10 to 12 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour in the prepared tomato purée.</li>
            <li>Mix it very well with the butter. Begin to cook the tomato purée on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals.</li>
            <li>The tomato purée mixture will start simmering. If the tomato purée splutters too much while cooking, then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter guard (channi lid).</li>
            <li>After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams).</li>
            <li>Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy. You can switch off the heat at this point.</li>
            <li>Now quickly add 1 teaspoon crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala to the gravy.</li>
            <li>Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and the remaining ginger julienne. You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving. Enjoy!</li>
