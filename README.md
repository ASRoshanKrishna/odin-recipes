# odin-recipes
This is the Odin-Recipes Project. A basic web page.
I am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
I will be using img tag for adding images to the site and anchor tag for adding hyperlinks.
I have used few basic CSS properties like font-family, size, bgcolor, color, align, margin, padding, float.
